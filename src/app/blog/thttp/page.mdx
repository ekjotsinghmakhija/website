Every developer has a "Tool of Shame."
For many, it is **Postman**.
It started as a simple Chrome extension.
It became a 500MB Electron behemoth that requires a login, cloud sync, and 10 seconds just to launch.
I just wanted to send a `GET` request. I didn't want to join a "Workspace."

So I looked at **Curl**.
Curl is legendary. It is installed on every device on Earth.
It is also unreadable.
`curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"foo":"bar"}' ...`
By the time I type the flags, I've forgotten the endpoint.
I built **tHttp** to find the middle ground.

## The Philosophy of Speed

**tHttp** (Terminal HTTP) is a CLI tool written in **Rust**.
It is designed to be:
1.  **Instant:** Startup time is sub-millisecond.
2.  **Readable:** It uses a simple, intuitive syntax.
3.  **Local:** No cloud, no sync, no login.

### The Syntax

I wanted the command to read like a sentence.

<div className="my-8 p-6 bg-[#0d1117] border border-stone-800 rounded-lg font-mono text-sm shadow-xl">
  <div className="text-stone-500 mb-2"># The Old Way (Curl)</div>
  <div className="text-rose-400 mb-6 break-all">
    curl -X POST https://api.server.com/users \<br/>
    -H "Authorization: Bearer 123" \<br/>
    {/* FIXED: Escaped curly braces below with backslashes */}
    -d '\{ "name": "Ekjot" \}'
  </div>

  <div className="text-stone-500 mb-2"># The tHttp Way</div>
  <div className="text-green-400 font-bold">
    thttp post api.server.com/users name=Ekjot @auth
  </div>
</div>

## Why Rust?
I could have written this in Node.js. It would have taken an hour.
But Node.js requires the V8 engine to boot up.
For a CLI tool that you run hundreds of times a day, those 200ms of startup latency accumulate into a feeling of <span className="text-amber-400">sluggishness</span>.
Rust gives us **Native Binary Performance**.
When you hit Enter, the request is already leaving the network card before your finger lifts off the key.
* **Memory Safety:** No segfaults when parsing malformed JSON.
* **Binaries:** A single file you can drop into `/usr/local/bin`.
* **Async/Await:** Rust's Tokio runtime handles concurrent requests better than almost anything else.

## The Death of the GUI

We are seeing a return to the terminal.
Developers are realizing that dragging a mouse to click "Send" is slower than typing.
**tHttp** is my contribution to this renaissance.

Stop waiting for Electron windows to load.
