The internet feels opaque. You visit a website, and you see what they *want* you to see: the landing page, the marketing copy, the shiny buttons.
But underneath that UI layer, the server is screaming information about itself. You just need to know how to listen.

**WibesCheck** is a digital stethoscope.

## Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)

OSINT is the art of gathering intelligence from publicly available sources. It is what hackers do before they attack. It is what security researchers do to defend.
I built WibesCheck to automate the reconnaissance phase of security auditing.

With a single command, WibesCheck performs a deep scan:
* **Tech Stack Detection:** Identifies the frameworks (Next.js, React, Tailwind) by analyzing DOM fingerprints.
* **DNS Enumeration:** Finds hidden subdomains (`dev.site.com`, `admin.site.com`) that the owner forgot to hide.
* **Header Analysis:** Checks for missing security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options) that leave the door open for XSS attacks.

### The "Wibe"

I called it "WibesCheck" because security shouldn't be dry.
It gives you a "Vibe Score" for the target website. Is it locked down like Fort Knox? Or is it a leaky sieve leaking metadata?

In a world of black boxes, WibesCheck brings transparency. It reminds us that on the web, nothing is truly hidden.
