If you ask ChatGPT a question, it tries to please you.
If you ask Gemini, it tries to be safe. If you ask Claude, it tries to be nuanced.
But if you ask a single model to critique itself, it fails.
<span className="text-violet-400 font-bold">LLMs are sycophants.</span> They suffer from "Mode Collapse" in reasoning—they lock onto a probable answer and defend it, even if it's wrong.
They are the ultimate "Yes Men."

I built the **LLM Group Chat** to fire the Yes Man.

## The Boardroom Architecture

I didn't want a chatbot; I wanted a **Board of Directors**.
This project is a multi-agent consensus engine. Instead of a single model generating an answer, it orchestrates a "Blind Peer Review" between the giants: **GPT-4**, **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**, and **Gemini Pro**.

### The Protocol

1.  **The Prompt:** User asks a complex question (e.g., *"Critique this system architecture"*).
2.  **Blind Generation:** All three models generate answers independently, hidden from each other.
3.  **The Roast:** Model A reads Model B's answer (anonymously) and tears it apart.
4.  **The Synthesis:** A "Chairman" Agent (running on a high-temp prompt) reads the debate and synthesizes a final, high-fidelity truth.

> **The Axiom:** "Intelligence is not found in the neuron, but in the conversation."

## Why It Works

It turns out that **LLMs are better critics than creators**.
Even a smaller model can spot a hallucination in a larger model's output if asked specifically to critique it.
By forcing adversarial debate, we reduce hallucination rates by nearly <strong className="text-fuchsia-400">40%</strong>.

We turned the "black box" into a **Glass Conference Room**.
