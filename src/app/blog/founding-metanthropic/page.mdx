<NotebookLayout meta={meta}>

Today marks a significant milestone in my career and research. I founded **Metanthropic AI** because I believe the current paradigm of AI development faces a critical <span className="text-rose-400 font-bold font-serif italic">Alignment Gap</span>.

We are currently building engines of immense power, but treating their steering mechanisms as an afterthought. Safety is too often treated as a post-training patch—a layer of "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback" (RLHF) slapped onto a completed model like a sticker on a rocket engine.

My thesis is straightforward but demanding: **True Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) cannot be built by simply scaling parameters; it must be architected for understanding.**

For the past year, I have been working to establish an independent lab that operates differently. We are not interested in incremental improvements. We are architecting novel large-scale models from scratch, integrating <span className="text-blue-400 font-bold">interpretability</span> and <span className="text-purple-400 font-bold">safety objectives</span> directly into the pre-training compute loop.

## The Core Thesis

Under my leadership, Metanthropic operates on a single defining principle: **Capability and Safety are not opposing forces.**

In traditional engineering, safety often comes at the cost of speed (think of nuclear regulations). In Intelligence Engineering, I argue the opposite: **Safe systems are more capable systems.**

A model that hallucinates is unsafe *and* incompetent. A model that deceives is misaligned *and* unreliable. By solving for safety (robustness, truthfulness, stability), we are inherently solving for capability.

> **The Axiom:** "The path to AGI requires a deep, empirical understanding of increasingly general systems."

## Our Research Agenda

Our work pushes the frontier of deep learning across three integrated pillars. We are moving beyond standard transformer implementations to architect next-generation models designed for high efficiency and massive scale.

## The Road Ahead

The development of AGI presents the greatest technical opportunity of our time, but it necessitates an uncompromising commitment to rigor.

We are moving alignment from **theoretical philosophy** to **rigorous engineering**. We are ensuring the path to AGI remains broadly beneficial and accessible.

This is the most challenging and important technical work I have ever undertaken. I am excited to finally share our progress as we push the boundaries of what is possible.
